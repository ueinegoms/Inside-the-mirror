 Unity game about a dream using a C# algorithm that creates a procedural maze

 This is a project that started my urge to create a series of games that were dreams. This being the first dream, isn't even a dream that I had, it's from a friend, and it's unfinished as you can see.
 
 Until now you have a procedurally maze generator algorithm that I created, a player controller script and some 3d models.
